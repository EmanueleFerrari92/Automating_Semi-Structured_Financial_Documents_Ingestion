"content=\"**Notes from previous steps:** \\n[Note 1]: SUPERVISOR NOTE: There are duplicate entries for item04. Please identify the correct entry and remove the false positive. The first entry on page 29 seems correct, while the second entry on page 54 appears to be a false positive.\\n[Note 2]: NOTE FROM FALSE POSITIVES ASSISTANT: The first candidate (id: 5250) for item04 is confirmed as the correct heading, as it appears in the context of the document and is properly formatted as 'Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure'. The second candidate (id: 9530) is a false positive, as it is part of a list and not a standalone heading, indicated by the presence of '\u202095.' which suggests it is a reference rather than a heading.\\n[ACTIONS TAKEN]: id 5250 with label item04 was selected.
