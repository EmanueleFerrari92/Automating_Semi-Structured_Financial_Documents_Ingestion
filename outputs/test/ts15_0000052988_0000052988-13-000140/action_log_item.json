Mine Safety Disclosure'. The second candidate (id: 9530) is a false positive, as it is part of a list and not a standalone heading, indicated by the presence of '\u202095.' which suggests it is a reference rather than a heading.\n[ACTIONS TAKEN]: id 5250 with label item04 was selected. Reason: This entry is confirmed as the correct item heading for item 4, as it is presented in a standalone format and is part of the main text discussing mine safety disclosures.", "SUPERVISOR NOTE: All items from item01 to item15 are present and correctly identified.
