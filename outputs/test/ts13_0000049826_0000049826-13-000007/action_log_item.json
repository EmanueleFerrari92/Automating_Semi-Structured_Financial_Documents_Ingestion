["SUPERVISOR NOTE: Please resolve the duplicate entries for item07 and item09a. There are two entries for each: item07 with ids 1170 and 3460, and item09a with ids 19680 and 19690. Identify the correct entries and remove the false positives.", "NOTE FROM FALSE POSITIVES ASSISTANT: After reviewing the context for the candidates, I determined the correct entries for item07 and item09a. The entry for item07 on page 14 (id: 3460) is a standalone heading and clearly marked as 'ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' The other entry (id: 1170) is a reference to item 7 and not a standalone heading. For item09a, the entry (id: 19680) is a proper heading, while the other entry (id: 19690) lacks the item number and is not a standalone heading. Therefore, I will keep id: 3460 for item07 and id: 19680 for item09a, removing the false positives.\n[ACTIONS TAKEN]: id 3460 with label item07 was selected. Reason: This entry is a clear standalone heading for item 7, properly formatted and located on the correct page.\n id 19680 with label item09a was selected. Reason: This entry is a proper heading for item 9a, clearly marked and located on the correct page.", "SUPERVISOR NOTE: All duplicates have been resolved, and the sequence of items is complete and correct. There are no missing or broken items. The document is ready for validation."]
