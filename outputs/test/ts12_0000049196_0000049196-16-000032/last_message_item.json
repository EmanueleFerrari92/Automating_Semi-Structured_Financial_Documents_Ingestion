"content=\"**Notes from previous steps:** \\n[Note 1]: SUPERVISOR NOTE: Please resolve the duplicate entries for item06 found on page 27. There are two entries with IDs 5280 and 5290. Determine which one is the correct heading for item06.\\n[Note 2]: NOTE FROM FALSE POSITIVES ASSISTANT: After reviewing the context for both candidates for item06, it is clear that ID 5280 contains the correct heading 'Item 6: Selected Financial Data' as a standalone item. In contrast, ID 5290 is a subheading under the table and does not serve as a standalone item heading. Therefore, ID 5280 should be retained as the correct entry for item06.\\n[ACTIONS TAKEN]: id 5280 with label item06 was selected. Reason: ID 5280 contains the correct standalone heading 'Item 6: Selected Financial Data', while ID 5290 is merely a subheading of a table and not a valid item heading.\\n[Note 3]: SUPERVISOR NOTE: Please fix the item heading for ID 1490, labeled as item07 on page 4. It appears to be merged with other text blocks. The correct item07 heading is already detected on page 29 with ID 5630.\\n[Note 4]: NOTE FROM FIXER ASSISTANT: The item heading for ID 1490 was successfully extracted. It was initially merged with the preceding text block. The correct heading 'MD&A Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' is now isolated.\\n ACTION TAKEN: Target id: 1490 was fixed.\\n[Note 5]: SUPERVISOR NOTE: Please search for the missing items item09c and item16. These items are optional, but we need to confirm their absence or presence in the document. Ensure that no other items are missing or misplaced.\\n[Note 6]: NOTE FROM DETECTOR ASSISTANT: item 09c not present in the document, do not search for it!\\n[Note 7]: NOTE FROM DETECTOR ASSISTANT: item 16 not present in the document, do not search for it!\\n\\nHere is the last update of detected items: id: 1490, label: item07, page number: 4, \\nclean text: mbs mortgage-backed securities md&a management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\\n\\nid: 1950, label: item01, page number: 6, \\nclean text: item 1: business\\n\\nid: 3750, label: item01a, page number: 17, \\nclean text: item 1a: risk factors\\n\\nid: 4840, label: item01b, page number: 24, \\nclean text: item 1b: unresolved staff comments\\n\\nid: 4860, label: item02, page number: 24, \\nclean text: item 2: properties\\n\\nid: 4960, label: item03, page number: 24, \\nclean text: item 3: legal proceedings\\n\\nid: 5000, label: item04, page number: 25, \\nclean text: item 4: mine safety disclosures\\n\\nid: 5030, label: item05, page number: 25, \\nclean text: item 5: market for registrant\u2019s common equity, related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\\n\\nid: 5280, label: item06, page number: 27, \\nclean text: item 6: selected financial data\\n\\nid: 5630, label: item07, page number: 29, \\nclean text: item 7: management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\\n\\nid: 22550, label: item07a, page number: 93, \\nclean text: item 7a: quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\\n\\nid: 22570, label: item08, page number: 93, \\nclean text: item 8: financial statements and supplementary data\\n\\nid: 49090, label: item09, page number: 189, \\nclean text: item 9: changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure\\n\\nid: 49110, label: item09a, page number: 189, \\nclean text: item 9a: controls and procedures\\n\\nid: 49180, label: item09b, page number: 189, \\nclean text: item 9b: other information\\n\\nid: 49220, label: item10, page number: 189, \\nclean text: item 10: directors, executive officers and corporate governance\\n\\nid: 49240, label: item11, page number: 189, \\nclean text: item 11: executive compensation\\n\\nid: 49260, label: item12, page number: 189, \\nclean text: item 12: security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters equity compensation plan information\\n\\nid: 49440, label: item13, page number: 190, \\nclean text: item 13: certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence\\n\\nid: 49460, label: item14, page number: 190, \\nclean text: item 14: principal accountant fees and services\\n\\nid: 49490, label: item15, page number: 190, \\nclean text: item 15: exhibits and financial statement schedules\\n\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={} id='7c5b81b1-e418-4ec8-93f0-316b48ff101f'"
