["SUPERVISOR NOTE: Please resolve the duplicate entries for item08 on page 126. There are multiple entries with the same label and similar text, which need to be cleaned up to ensure only the correct entry remains.", "NOTE FROM FALSE POSITIVES ASSISTANT: After reviewing the candidates for item08, it is clear that the entries from IDs 33520 and 33540 are not standalone headings but rather references to item 8 within the context of internal control over financial reporting. Therefore, they should be excluded. The only valid candidate is ID 16190, which is a proper heading for item 8.\n[ACTIONS TAKEN]: id 16190 with label item08 was selected. Reason: This entry is a standalone heading for item 8, clearly stating 'item 8. financial statements and supplementary data', making it the only correct candidate to retain.", "SUPERVISOR NOTE: All mandatory items from item01 to item15 are present and correctly ordered. There are no duplicates or broken headings. Optional items item01c, item09c, and item16 are not present, which is acceptable. Proceeding to validation."]
