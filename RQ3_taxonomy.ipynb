    "Table elements, even if they contain bold or italic text, are not to be considered headings or subheadings.\n",

    "Headings/Subheadings vs. Paragraphs\n",
    "A heading or subheading is typically followed by either a lower-level heading/subheading or a paragraph of text.\n",
    "Do not consider a text block that ends with a table or references a table as a heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broken or Merged Headings\n",
    "If a heading or subheading is split across multiple text blocks, combine them into a single heading.\n",
    "If a heading or subheading is merged with a paragraph, isolate just the heading portion.\n",
    "If you suspect a heading is deeper in the hierarchy (e.g., a sub-subheading) and it appears in-line, you may append “...” at the end of the heading to reflect its deeper structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Markdown Formatting\n",
    "Return your identified headings and subheadings using Markdown or another clear textual format (e.g., bold, italics, uppercase) to set them apart from paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Requirements:\n",
    "List of Newly Detected Headings/Subheadings\n",
    "Present them in the correct hierarchical order.\n",
    "Exclude any table elements from this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty List\n",
    "If the page has no new headings or subheadings, return an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale \n",
    "In your chain of thought, briefly consider all possible heading candidates and explain why you included or excluded them (particularly excluding table elements)\"\"\"\n",
